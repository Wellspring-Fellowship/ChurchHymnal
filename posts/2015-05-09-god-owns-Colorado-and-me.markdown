Christ owns the cattle on a thousand hills,
that walk upon the grass between the crevices.
He owns my soul, He died on he cross,
Eternal life He brought us.

Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.

God owns the snow on top the mountain peaks,
Melt running down the creeks and through the rivers.
He owns our faith, a gift from on high,
By which He has made us believers.

Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.

God owns the fragrance of the valley's rain,
The scent of Aspen tree leaf and the Evergreens too.
He owns the fragrance this sacred life savory aroma from me and you.

Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.
