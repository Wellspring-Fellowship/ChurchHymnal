As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after thee.
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee.

Chorus:
You alone are my strength, my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee

You're my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are a king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything

Chorus:
You alone are my strength, my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee

I want you more than gold or silver,
only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joygiver
and the apple of my eye.

Chorus:
You alone are my strength, my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
