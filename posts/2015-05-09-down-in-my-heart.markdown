 I have the joy, joy, joy, joy,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
I have the joy, joy, joy, joy,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

Refrain:
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.

I have the peace that passes understanding
down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
I have the peace that passes understanding
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

Refrain:
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.

I have the love of Jesus, love of Jesus,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart,
I have the love of Jesus, love of Jesus,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

Refrain:
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.
And I'm so happy, so very happy
I have the love of Jesus in my heart.
