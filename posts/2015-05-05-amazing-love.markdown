I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again

Amazing love
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love
I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You,
In all I do, to honor You

I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again

Amazing love
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love
I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You,
In all I do, to honor You

You are my King,
You are my King,
Jesus You are my King
Jesus You are my King
