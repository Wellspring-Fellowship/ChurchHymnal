Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
The glories of my God and King!
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!

Refrain:
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
   
Jesus! the Name that calms my fears,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!

Refrain:
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!

He breaks the pow’r of canceled sin,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
His blood can make the foulest clean,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!

Refrain:
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
   
I never shall forget that day,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
When Jesus washed my sins away,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!

Refrain:
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
Blessed be the Name, blessed be the Name,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord!
