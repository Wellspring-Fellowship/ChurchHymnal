Lord I lift Your name on high.
Lord I love to sing Your praises.
I'm so glad Your in my life.
I'm so glad You came to save us.

[Chorus:]
You came from heaven to earth
to show the way;
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay.
From the cross to the grave,
from the grave to the sky,
Lord I lift Your name on high
