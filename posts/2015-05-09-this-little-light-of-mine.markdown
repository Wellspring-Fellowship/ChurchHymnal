This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Hide it under a bushel - NO!
I'm gonna let it shine,
Hide it under a bushel - NO!
I'm gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Don't let Satan blow it out.
I'm gonna let it shine
Don't let Satan blow it out.
I'm gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
