Peter and John went to pray.
They met a lame man on the way.

He asked for alms and held out his palms,
And this is what Peter did say,

"Silver and gold have I none,
But such as I have give I thee,

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
He went walking and leaping and praising God,
Walking and leaping and praising God,
In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
