Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness;
And all these things shall be added unto you.
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God.
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

Ask, and it shall be given unto you;
Seek, and ye shall find.
Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you.
Hallelu, Hallelujah!
