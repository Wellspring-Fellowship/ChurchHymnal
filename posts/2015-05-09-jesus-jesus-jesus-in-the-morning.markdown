Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus in the morning, Jesus in the noontime;
Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus when the sun goes down!

Praise him, praise him,
Praise him in the morning, praise him in the noontime;
Praise him, praise him,
Praise him when the sun goes down!

Love him, love him,
Love him in the morning, love him in the noontime;
Love him, love him,
Love him when the sun goes down!

Serve him, serve him,
Serve him in the morning, serve him in the noontime;
Serve him, serve him,
Serve him when the sun goes down!

Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus in the morning, Jesus in the noontime;
Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus when the sun goes down!
