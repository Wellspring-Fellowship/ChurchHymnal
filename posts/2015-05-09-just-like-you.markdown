Oh Lord, I want to follow only You.
Oh Lord, I want to follow only You.
I want to follow, I want to follow.
Oh Lord, I want to follow only You.


Oh Lord, give me wisdom to know what to do.
Oh Lord, give me wisdom to know what to do.
I need Your wisdom, I need Your wisdom.
Oh Lord, give me wisdom to know what to do.

Oh Lord, grant us repentance toward You.
Oh Lord, grant us repentance toward You.
Heal our hard hearts, Lord.  Heal our hard hearts, Lord.
Oh Lord, grant us repentance toward You.

Oh Lord, I want to be just like You.
Oh Lord, I want to be just like You.
Be just like You, Lord.  Be just like You, Lord.
Oh Lord, I want to be just like You.
