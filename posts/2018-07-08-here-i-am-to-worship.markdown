Light of the world, You step down into darkness.
Opened my eyes let me see.
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with you.

Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days,
So highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly you came to the earth you created.
All for love's sake became poor.

So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.

Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God.
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God.
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
