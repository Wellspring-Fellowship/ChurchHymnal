that walk upon the grass between the crevices.
He owns my soul, He died on he cross,
Eternal life He brought us.</p>
<p>Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.</p>
<p>God owns the snow on top the mountain peaks,
Melt running down the creeks and through the rivers.
He owns our faith, a gift from on high,
By which He has made us believers.</p>
<p>Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.</p>
<p>God owns the fragrance of the valleyâ€™s rain,
The scent of Aspen tree leaf and the Evergreens too.
He owns the fragrance this sacred life savory aroma from me and you.</p>
<p>Chorus:
Does He love me? Does He own me?
Yes He loves you. Yes He owns you.
Do you love Him? Do you own Him?
Yes I love Him.  Yes I own Him.</p>
