Come just as you are;
Come to the Savior, a new life begin,
Oh, come just as you are.</p>
<p>Refrain:
Come just as you are,
Oh, come just as you are;
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,
And come just as you are.</p>
<p>Deep in your heart sin has written its scar,
Come just as you are;
Though from your Father youâ€™ve wandered afar,
Oh, come just as you are.</p>
<p>Refrain:
Come just as you are,
Oh, come just as you are;
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,
And come just as you are.</p>
<p>Sinful and guilty, heart broken and lost,
Come just as you are;
Think what your ransom on Calvary cost!
Oh, come just as you are.</p>

Come just as you are,
Oh, come just as you are;
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,
And come just as you are.</p>
<p>Naught with your goodness for sin can atone,
Come just as you are;
Trust in the merit of Jesus alone,
And come just as you are.</p>
<p>Refrain:
Come just as you are,
Oh, come just as you are;
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,
And come just as you are.</p>
<p>Come with your heartaches, your sorrow and pain,
Come just as you are;
No one has come to the Savior in vain,
Oh, come just as you are.</p>
<p>Refrain:
Come just as you are,
Oh, come just as you are;
Turn from your sin, let the Savior come in,
And come just as you are.</p>
