From the curse to set me free.</p>

Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>

How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.</p>

His triumphant power I’ll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.</p>

And His heav’nly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God with Him to be.</p>

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.</p>
